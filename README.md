Blizard is a simple Control and Command (C2) server made using python. You can inject files, extract files and run any command on the target computer.
The C2 functionalities are working under a simple number guessing game, but you can change the game to be whatever you want.

After changing the IP and Port on the client.py file you can convert it into an .exe file and send it to your target.
While they are playing the game, you have total access to their machine.
